<<< undo local changes for a file: (even deleted)
 	
	git checkout -- <filename>
	
<<< optionally:
	
	git checkout HEAD path/to/file path/to/another_file


<<< Instead, to drop all your local changes and commits, fetch the latest history from the server and point your local master branch at it, do this:
	
	git fetch origin
	git reset --hard origin/master

	git reset HEAD

<<<< reset everything to your last commit. Note that 'git reset --hard HEAD' destroys any useful changes you have made in parent directories of the current working directory.

	git reset --hard HEAD	

<<<< If you do have uncommitted changes, but the 'git reset HEAD' doesn't work, then save your uncommitted changes with 'git stash'

	git stash
	git reset --hard HEAD
	git stash pop


!!! Don't attempt this code unless absolutely necessary!!!!
<<< Remove the history from >>>>

	rm -rf .git

	-- recreate the repos from the current content only
	git init
	git add .
	git commit -m "Initial commit"

<<< push to the github remote repos ensuring you overwrite history
	
	git remote add origin git@github.com:<YOUR ACCOUNT>/<YOUR REPOS>.git
	git push -u --force origin master
	
<<< >>>>>>>

!!! Don't attempt this code unless absolutely necessary!!!!
